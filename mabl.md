## Mabl
Mabl is an intelligent tool. Mabl addresses testing pain points speed, coverage and reliability.
1) Low Code. Easily create, run, and manage automated browser, API, and mobile web tests.
2) In-Depth Results. Gain visibility with comprehensive test results that streamline issue resolution.
3) API Testing. ...
4) Auto-Healing. ...
5) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10534266/138616576-068f6778-780d-4197-b66b-be60629e7592.png)
6) SaaS -> Software as a service
7) Data-Driven Testing. ...
8) Cross-Browser Testing -> Supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE
9) Mobile Web Testing. -> Create automated browser and API tests once and easily run them across multiple mobile device profiles.

## Advantages:
mabl combines the idea of auto-healing linear record and play testing, with advanced capabilities to meet the needs fast-moving teams.


## Auto-healing Tests
As modern websites have more dynamic user interfaces, such as AJAX applications, mabl collects multiple attributes to assist in recording specific data about an element. This enables mabl tests to navigate elements in a way that would normally require complicated scripting, and automatically update the underlying test scripts as apps evolve under development.


## Test Output Processing
With built-in regression testing (checking to see if there has been a change to previously functioning parts of a site), mabl uses machine intelligence to compare against past tests to spot anomalies in behavior, performance, visual elements in the application UI, and learns more as you test.


## Data-Driven Testing
You can define a set of parameters for a test, and run that test for each variation simultaneously, without re-recording each scenario separately.


## Reusable Flows
Similar to modular frameworks, you can define a flow, or set of steps, that you can reuse in multiple tests, or connect together to build a master test. If you ever need to update a flow, you can do so without it affecting the other flows, or the master test.


## Disadvantages:
They don’t have the same infinite flexibility as creating your own framework does, so if your application has complex edge cases, these types of tools might not be for your project. They’re also not open-source, so there is a subscription cost to consider.

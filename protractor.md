## Protractor

## What is Protractor Testing?
Protractor is an automation and end-to-end behavior-driven testing tool that plays an important role in the Testing of AngularJS applications and works as a Solution integrator combining powerful technologies like Selenium, Jasmine, Web driver, etc. The purpose of Protractor Testing is not only to test AngularJS applications but also for writing automated regression tests for normal Web Applications as well.

## Why canâ€™t we find Angular JS web elements using Normal Selenium Web driver?

Angular JS applications have some extra HTML attributes like ng-repeater, ng-controller, ng-model.., etc. which are not included in Selenium locators. Selenium is not able to identify those web elements using Selenium code. So, Protractor on the top of Selenium can handle and controls those attributes in Web Applications.

The protractor is an end to end testing framework for Angular JS based applications. While most frameworks focus on conducting unit tests for Angular JS applications, Protractor focuses on testing the actual functionality of an application.
